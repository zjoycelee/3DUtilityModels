# 3DUtilityModels

Welcome to the **3DUtilityModels** repository! This repository contains a collection of 3D models for various small utility tools that Iâ€™ve personally designed. These models are useful for my own purposes, and I hope they can be helpful to you as well.

## Features

- **Easy to Print**: All models are optimized for FDM 3D printers and are easy to print.

## Folder Structure

Each tool has its own dedicated folder, structured as follows:

- ToolName/
  - stls/      # STL files of the 3D models
  - assets/    # Images, renders, and documentation related to the models
  - 3mf/       # 3MF files for more detailed print configurations

## License

This project is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). You are free to use and modify the models, but please provide proper attribution.

## How to Use

1. Download the STL or 3MF file of the model you want to print.
2. Open the file in your 3D slicing software (e.g., Cura, PrusaSlicer, or Bambu Studio).
3. Adjust settings as needed and start printing.
4. Once printed, assemble the parts (if necessary), and enjoy your new tool!
